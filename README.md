This  project is based on hybrid data encryption utilizing the already existing data encryption techniques.
It uses the techniques of fibonaci sequence encrypting , XOR encrypting and PN encrypting.
The XOR encryption and PN encryption require randomly generated numbers to operate.
It divides a message into 3 parts and applies these techniques to each part which produces a encrypted form  of the message.
It further dencrypts the encrypted message by applying the same logic i.e. by dividing the encrypted message into 3 parts and applying the 3 techniques in each part in order to dencrypt the message.
